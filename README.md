# AI Security Resources

This repository is a **curated list of resources on AI security**. It is designed to serve as a resource hub for researchers, practitioners, and anyone interested in understanding and improving the security of AI systems.

With the increasing use of AI in critical domains, the risks associated with adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and system misuse have become more pronounced. This repository consolidates resources to build awareness and improve understanding of AI security.

* [AttackText](https://textattack.readthedocs.io/en/master/) is a Python framework for adversarial attacks, adversarial training, and data augmentation in Natural Language Proccessing. TextAttack makes experimenting with the robustness of Natural Language Proccessing models seamless, fast, and easy. It’s also useful for Natural Language Proccessing model training, adversarial training, adversarial testing with prompt engineering, and data augmentation.
